Hi! this is my final project for my MPS in communications design degree for my type and interaction class. I hope you enjoy!

Problem:  
As we as product designers transition from our MPS degree to the professional world, creative freedom often takes a backseat to client demands. Designing purely for enjoyment becomes rare, making it easy to feel disconnected from the passion that once fueled their creativity. Without structured opportunities to design for themselves, many may struggle to maintain their love for the craft amidst deadlines and constraints. This project aims to address that issue by helping designers reclaim time for personal creative exploration. It is called the design dopamine menu, as it is intended to be used during our corporate lunch breaks -- the only free time we will have during the work day.  

Description:
The project, Design Dopamine, is an activity suggester tailored for our MPS cohort, offering a menu of creative exercises based on available free time, energy level and if you want an on screen or off screen activity. Whether a you have five minutes or two hours, the tool will provide activity recommendations that encourage personal creative growth. This website will allow us to always engage in fulfilling, self-driven design work, no matter how much time we have.  

Purpose: 
The goal of Design Dopamine is to help our cohort maintain our passion for creativity even in a structured work environment. By providing quick, engaging design prompts, the tool encourages users to treat design as both work and play. It supports mental well-being by reinforcing the joy of creation, ensuring that even short breaks can be used for personal creative fulfillment. The project also serves as a learning opportunity, enhancing technical skills in the design world.

Features: 
The tool will include a dropdown input where users select their available time effort and type of activity they want, generating a list of suggested activities. It also works with no input, or only 1 or 2 fields. I have made  this possible through and Vanilla javascript.
